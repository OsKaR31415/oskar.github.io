        Doomsday algorithm :

The Doomsday algorithm is a method to tell which day were a given date. For example, if you input is the 24 of January 1984, the result will be Tuesday, because the 24 of January 1984 was a Tuesday.

But the method is actually so speed that, with training, you could potentially apply it in about one second for a particulat year that you know well, and within seconds for any year you learned.

In order to train myself to this method, I programmed my computer so that, each time i switch it on, it gives me a random date and asks me the matching day. So, if you want to enter into my computer, you can either cheat on a calendar, either learn the Doomsday algorithm...
